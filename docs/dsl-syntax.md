# Catapult DSL — syntax reference (v0)

**Status:** the normative syntax for the DSL core, consolidating the
v4 spec's §A.2 with every v5 delta (v5 §6, §9). Where this document
and the v4 spec disagree, this document wins. The Phase 3 loader
ticket implements exactly these productions; reconciliation verifies
the loader against this file. Grammar changes are reviewed edits
here first, code second.

Two design invariants govern everything below (v5 §6, §9): **closed
vocabularies everywhere** — no bundle-side code, no
Turing-completeness, every enumerable set enumerated — and **the
core is frozen; growth happens in extensions** (§12 below).

---

## 1. On-disk layout

```
catapult.yaml                  # repo root: pins the active bundle
bundles/<name>/
  bundle.yaml                  # registry: name, version, extends, file lists
  tiers/<tier>.yaml            # one file per tier declaration
  edges/<edge>.yaml            # one file per named edge instance
  predicates.yaml              # optional: named predicates
  prompts/<tier>.md.liquid     # one per LLM-generator tier
  prompts/review/<tier>.md.liquid
  prompts/partials/<name>.md.liquid   # shared fragments ({% render %})
  schemas/<name>.xsd           # body grammars referenced by tiers
  flows/<flow>/flow.yaml       # one directory per flow
  flows/<flow>/<prompt>.md.liquid
```

`catapult.yaml`:

```yaml
bundle: default          # directory name under bundles/
```

## 2. bundle.yaml

```yaml
name: default
version: "1.0.0"
extends: platform-elixir          # optional; content layering (§11)
tiers: [tiers/*.yaml]             # glob lists; the loaded bundle is the union
edges: [edges/*.yaml]
fragments: [techspec, pubapi, privapi, policies, failure_surface]
flows: [flows/*/flow.yaml]
```

Fragment kinds are a **closed vocabulary per bundle**: a kind used in
any `handle:` or `produces:` must appear here.

## 3. Tier declarations

```yaml
tier: comparch                    # unique within the loaded union
scope: per(comp)                  # §3.1
scope_filter: is_domain           # optional predicate (§8)
identity: id                      # id | alias | name
fields:                           # scalar projections of body content
  name: draft.name
  techspec: draft.techspec
handle:                           # the public surface downstream walks read
  fields: [id, name]
  fragments: [techspec, pubapi]
draft:                            # omit entirely for join-target tiers
  root_tag: comparch
  grammar: schemas/comparch.xsd
generator: llm                    # §3.2
prompt: prompts/comparch.md.liquid
executor:                         # optional; how the generation runs
  effort: max                     # effort hint (v5 §B.2.4 lineage)
  # The design dialect's executor is agent-dispatch, always (v5 §1.2:
  # agents end-to-end); the runtime dialect uses the completion
  # adapter. Profile selection is dialect-level; `executor:` carries
  # per-tier hints (effort, model tier), not the mechanism.
context:                          # ordered edge-walk expressions (§7)
  - self.parent.handle
  - self.parent.fulfills -> resp.handle
  - self.parent.dependency -> target.handle.fragments[pubapi]
produces:                         # fragments this draft writes on other nodes
  - fragment: { owner: self.parent, kind: techspec, authored: draft.techspec }
review:                           # optional; presence enables the review pass
  prompt: prompts/review/comparch.md.liquid
  grammar: schemas/review.xsd
  required: false                 # true gates approval on review commit
delivery:                         # extension-provided namespace (§12)
  phase: Architecting
  gate: Architecture review
enforcement: []                   # extension-provided profiles, e.g. [codegen: restricted]
```

Per-scope attributes that appear in *body* declarations rather than
tier files (they vary per node, not per tier): `implementation:
stubbed | real` with `swap: transparent | migration | reset` (v5
§2.16), declared in the comparch grammar; `locus: server | client`
(v5 §5.6) on backend-family component declarations.

### 3.1 Scope expressions — closed set

- `singleton` — one node per project.
- `per(X)` — one node per node of tier X. `self.parent` is that node.
- `child_of(X)` — nodes minted by X's fanout edge.

**Delta from v4: the phased variants (`per(X) × phase`) are removed**
with the phase machinery (v5 §6). There is no `phase` dimension.

### 3.2 Generator types — closed set, extension-growable

`llm` (default), `git_commit` (+ `code_repo_url`, `path_from_handle`),
`synthesis`, `webhook`, and the v5 additions: **`external`** (content
resolves from the component registry at the pinned version; requires
`package:` and optional `options:` per v5 §3.4) and **`template`**
(deterministic scaffold; requires `template:` path; slots filled from
context walks; no LLM call, same grammar validation).

## 4. Edge declarations

```yaml
edge: dependency                  # unique name within the union
type: dependency                  # fanout | reference | dependency |
                                  #   policy_application | synthesis
source: comp
target: comp
declared_in: comp.draft.dependencies[].@to
cardinality:
  source: { min: 0 }              # {min, max}; max default unbounded
  target: { min: 0 }
  # optional refinements:
  # when: kind == presentational
  # per_source: comp
graph_constraint: [acyclic, no_self_loop]   # also: tree
consistency: eventual             # dependency edges only:
                                  #   eventual (default) | transactional
                                  #   (v5 §2.6 — transactional couplings
                                  #   are declared, enumerable state)
```

Rules carried from v4, still normative: the full edge-instance graph
must be **type-level acyclic** at load; `graph_constraint: acyclic`
is additionally checked per-instance at projection time; `declared_in`
paths parse against committed bodies.

**v5 rule:** navigation edges (product tier, screen→screen) are
cyclic-legal reference edges and **must never appear in a readiness-
bearing context walk** — the loader rejects a context entry that
traverses an edge marked `navigation: true`.

## 5. Fragments

Authored-only (no derived fragments — derived views are context
walks). Declared in `bundle.yaml`'s closed vocabulary; written via
`produces:`; read via `handle.fragments` and
`...fragments[<kind>]` walk projections. Ownership and authorship
are projection state.

## 6. Flows

```yaml
flow: capability
delta:                            # schema delta while the flow is open
  tiers: [tiers/capability_plan.yaml]
  edges: []
walk: downward_cascade            # downward_cascade | up_then_down
ticket:                           # the delivery face (v5 §7.10)
  entry: requirements             # cascade start; upstream gates skip as no_diff
  labels: []
completion: capability_complete   # named predicate (§8)
```

Scaffolding is **not** a flow: it is the base schema with a ticket
face and an empty delta (v5 §7.10). The `up_then_down` walk's first
planning step decides how far up to go; terminating at height zero is
legal (v5 §7.11).

## 7. Context walks

Anatomy (unchanged from v4 §A.2.5): `self`, `self.parent`,
`.<edge_name>` follows a declared edge, `-> <tier>.<projection>`
types the target and names what to read — `.handle`,
`.handle.fragments[<kind>]`, `.synthesis`. Cardinality-many walks
yield collections; readiness requires **all** targets ready.
Context is the only readiness signal.

v5 additions:

- **`input.<role>`** — reads the intake documents tagged with a
  declared role (`input.project_doc`, `input.behavior_docs`; roles
  registered in the platform layer, v5 §7.3's intake list).
  **Roles are optional classification of a free-form raft, never
  requirements**: a role with no documents yields an empty
  collection and **never blocks readiness** (v5 §1.1 — requiring a
  specific file in the raft is the recorded antipattern).
  **`input.*`** reads the whole raft (the intake distillation
  tiers' walk). Both forms **resolve to the versions pinned at
  intake, always** — input documents freeze after the scaffold pass
  (v5 §1.1); a later file edit changes nothing a walk reads and
  stales nothing.
- **`ticket.findings`** — extension-provided source (§12): validation
  findings + ticket thread for the scope, available to flow planning
  tiers only (v5 §7.11).

## 8. Predicate language

Unchanged from v4 §A.2.6 and deliberately not Turing-complete. Six
operator families: comparison (`== != < > <= >=`), boolean
(`AND OR NOT`), edge counting (`has_edge`, `count(...) op N`),
existential (`exists(path where p)`), universal (`all/any(path ->
field)`), reachability (`reaches(a, b, via=[...])`). Exactly four
slots: `scope_filter`, `cardinality.when`, edge `constraint`, flow
`completion`. Named predicates compose in `predicates.yaml`; no
arithmetic, strings, or regex.

## 9. Prompts

Liquid (Solid). Variables: one per named context walk
(cardinality-many walks iterate), `self`, `feedback`, `prior_review`,
and — review prompts only — `draft`. Shared content via
`{% render "partials/<name>" %}` (v5 §6: one source for shared
framing across the six architecture tiers). Generation and review
templates for a tier receive identical context plus `draft` — the
per-tier triad invariant, enforced by the shared context-assembly
path, not convention.

## 10. Grammars

Body grammars are XML-fragmented markdown validated per tier
(`draft.root_tag` + XSD), at commit time, atomically — validation
failure is typed feedback, never a half-committed state. The review
grammar is platform-wide (v4 §B.3.2's `<review>` shape). v5 grammar
growth (the productions, not the prose): comparch carries
`<permissions>`, `<enforcement>`, per-scope `<implementation>`;
subcomparch carries the process inventory; impl's `<tests>` block is
normative for reconciliation.

## 11. `extends:` — content layering

A bundle naming `extends: <layer>` loads the layer first, then
overlays: **declarations union; same-path files replace; the
protocol's own files never override** (delivery states/types/
escalation ship in the platform layer and are not overlayable — v5
§7.10). Cycles in `extends:` chains are load errors. Layering
composes *content*; it never adds vocabulary — that is §12's job,
and the two mechanisms are deliberately distinct (v5 §9).

## 12. Extension registration — the platform surface

Extensions are **platform-shipped modules** (never bundle content)
that register with the loader:

- **annotation namespaces** on existing declaration kinds (`delivery:`,
  `enforcement:`), each with a validation schema;
- **declaration kinds** (new file types — the flow ticket face);
- **generator types** (beyond §3.2's set);
- **context sources** (`ticket.findings`);
- **enforcement profiles** (`codegen: restricted`,
  `purity: replay_floor`) binding audit checks and/or delivery gates.

The loader validates the union of core + installed extensions; an
annotation against an uninstalled extension is a load error naming
the missing extension. A **dialect** is core + extension set +
defaults; two are registered: `design` (full Catapult) and `runtime`
(the embedded generation runtime, v5 §10 — no review lifecycle, no
git bodies).

## 13. Load-time validation

All-problems-at-once (orchestration's config style): unknown fields
rejected; every cross-reference resolves (edge endpoints, fragment
kinds, prompt/schema paths, predicate names); scope expressions and
generator types from the closed sets; type-level acyclicity over the
edge-instance graph; cardinality shapes well-formed; `delivery:`
values validated against the protocol vocabulary; navigation edges
absent from readiness walks; `extends:` acyclic. A bundle that loads
is a bundle the engine can run; only instance-level constraints
(dependency cycles, cardinality counts) wait for projection time.

## 14. Deliberately absent

Recorded so nobody re-adds them: **phases** (v5 §6 — dropped
entirely); **spawn declarations** (a plane rule at the Building
transition, not bundle content); **derived fragments** (context
walks at read time); **bundle-side code or open predicates**; **per-
project protocol restructuring** (bindings are plane entities, v5
§7.10).
