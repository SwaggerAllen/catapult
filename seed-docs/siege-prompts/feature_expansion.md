You are extracting structured features from an unstructured project description. Your output is the **first layer of handles** the entire generation chain will build on — the requirements pass downstream will redistribute your features into system-level responsibilities, and it needs each feature's intent to name specific enough capabilities that it can identify what the system must guarantee.

**Features are workflows and persona stories, not engineering categories.** A feature names what a user (or persona) accomplishes end-to-end; it does not name a layer, service, or technology choice. Keep a sharp eye on which axis you're on:

* Features: "a new customer completes onboarding end-to-end", "an admin flags suspicious activity and removes it", "a logged-in user sees their recent orders and re-orders one in two taps", "a teammate invites a colleague via email and the colleague accepts from a mobile browser".
* Not features (these are sysarch concerns — they show up later, redistributed as responsibilities assigned to components): "storage layer", "API gateway", "authentication service", "caching layer", "database schema", "session service", "notification queue".
* Not features (these are implementation details — they show up at component-arch time at the earliest): "use Redis for sessions", "Postgres table design", "React component tree", "GraphQL vs REST", "specific framework choice".

A feature called "User Management" gives requirements nothing to redistribute; a feature that names invite flows, session lifecycle, and credential reset gives requirements three concrete obligations to work with. Prefer specific, user-visible capabilities over engineering categories. Your features should also include things the user didn't explicitly name but the project obviously needs.

# Output format

Output three top-level blocks in this order: ``<introduction>``, ``<features>``, ``<vocabulary>``. The ``<introduction>`` is required — a short prose preamble (2–5 paragraphs) that captures your initial thinking about this project: what it fundamentally IS, which user goals shape the decomposition axis, which tensions or ambiguities you noticed in the input doc. Downstream tiers don't read this intro, but when *this* tier regenerates with feedback you (or a later model) can refer back to it to stay anchored in the initial framing rather than restarting from scratch. Write it like a memo to your future self working on the next revision.

After ``<introduction>``, output a single ``<features>`` block. Inside it, group related features under ``<group>`` blocks where that aids scannability, and place truly standalone features directly under ``<features>``. Each ``<feature>`` has exactly one ``<name>`` and exactly one ``<intent>`` child, and may optionally be marked ``<implicit/>`` when it's inferred rather than explicit. Each ``<group>`` has exactly one ``<name>`` (the theme label) and at least one ``<feature>``.

    <introduction>
      This project is a SaaS tenant-billing platform. The central     user goals are (1) new customers self-serve subscribe without     sales contact, (2) existing customers see exactly what they     owe and when, (3) support can reverse an over-charge in one     action. Payment lifecycle is the load-bearing axis; auth and     notifications are supporting workflows.

      Input doc tensions worth flagging on regen: the "plans"     and "add-ons" terminology is used interchangeably, and the     input implies both usage-based and seat-based pricing — I've     captured both and noted the open question in the Billing     group's intents.
    </introduction>
    <features>
      <group>
        <name>User Management</name>
        <feature>
          <name>Login</name>
          <intent>Users sign in with email and password. Sessions persist across browser restarts for up to 30 days unless the user signs out explicitly.</intent>
        </feature>
        <feature>
          <name>Password Reset</name>
          <intent>Users can request a password reset link via email. The link expires after 30 minutes and single-use.</intent>
          <implicit/>
        </feature>
      </group>
      <group>
        <name>Billing</name>
        <feature>
          <name>Subscription Tiers</name>
          <intent>Users can pay for tiered service plans via credit card, with monthly and annual billing cycles. Invoices are emailed to the account owner and available for download from the settings page. Failed payments trigger a grace-period retry schedule before suspending the account.</intent>
        </feature>
      </group>
      <feature>
        <name>Global Search</name>
        <intent>Global search across all content the user has access to, with keyword matching and recency ranking.</intent>
      </feature>
    </features>

# Rules

* Use the tag structure exactly as shown. Each ``<feature>`` has exactly one ``<name>`` and exactly one ``<intent>``, optionally followed by an ``<implicit/>`` marker. No other tags inside a feature.
* ``<name>`` (on a feature) is a short identifier — typically 2 to 5 words, title case. Name the feature by what it does for the user, not by the engineering category it sits in. "Password Reset" is sharper than "Credential Management"; "Subscription Tiers" is sharper than "Billing"; "Collaborative Editing" is sharper than "Content Management". If the name could label a section in any SaaS product's marketing page without modification, it's probably too generic — push toward what makes this project's version of that capability distinctive.
* ``<intent>`` is a short paragraph — typically 2 to 5 sentences, longer only when the feature is complex. Describe *what* the feature does and *why*, not *how* it will be built. The requirements pass downstream will read each intent to identify the system-level guarantees the feature implies — name specific data, operations, and failure conditions so requirements can extract concrete obligations. "Users can pay for things" gives requirements nothing; "Users can pay for tiered service plans via credit card, with monthly and annual billing cycles; failed payments trigger a grace-period retry before suspending the account" gives requirements payment processing, invoice delivery, retry scheduling, and account suspension as four distinct system obligations to work with.
* **Implicit features.** Mark a feature with ``<implicit/>`` when it's something the project obviously needs but the user did not explicitly call out in the input doc — e.g. authentication for anything with user accounts, password reset wherever there's login, email notifications wherever there are asynchronous events, onboarding wherever there's a new-user flow. Inferring these is a core part of the expansion's job. Explicit features (things the user did name in the input doc) do not get the marker.
* **Groups.** Bundle related features under ``<group>`` blocks with a short ``<name>`` identifying the theme (e.g. "User Management", "Billing", "Content", "Notifications"). A group contains exactly one ``<name>`` and one or more ``<feature>`` entries. Groups do not nest — every feature lives in at most one group. Features that don't fit a theme can sit directly under ``<features>`` without a group wrapper.
* Aim for breadth, not depth. The feature expansion is the seed for the structured feature graph; each feature gets its own detailed decomposition later.
* Do not fabricate constraints the input doc doesn't imply. Implicit features should be things the project obviously needs given what it IS, not features from unrelated projects.
* Do not include meta-commentary about what you are doing, what the tags mean, or how you arrived at the list. Output only the ``<features>`` block.
* Unescaped ``&`` and ``<`` in the intent text are fine — the parser tolerates them.
* **Feature names must be unique** across the entire ``<features>`` block. Two features with the same name are rejected. Names are identifiers downstream passes use to reference features; duplicates would make those references ambiguous.

# Vocabulary (optional but strongly encouraged)

You may include a ``<vocabulary>`` block **after** the ``<features>`` block, at the top level of your output — at the same nesting as ``<features>``, not inside it. Both blocks are siblings of whatever implicit root the parser extracts. The vocabulary block captures terms the project uses in a project-specific sense — anything where a generic LLM reading the term in isolation would get the meaning subtly wrong. Emit one whenever the input doc genuinely has project-specific terminology; if the project is too generic for any term to warrant defining, omit the block rather than padding it with filler (the user can always add vocabulary entries later).

The grammar:

    <vocabulary>
      <term name="tranche" scope="feature" feature-name="Billing">
        <vocab-entry>
          <definition>
            A time-bounded batch of invoices processed together     in a single settlement cycle.
          </definition>
          <disambiguation>
            Not a financial instrument — this project's     tranches are operational batches, not debt-security slices.
          </disambiguation>
          <see-also>
            <ref name="settlement window"/>
            <ref name="invoice batch"/>
          </see-also>
        </vocab-entry>
      </term>
      <term name="session" scope="project">
        <vocab-entry>
          <definition>
            An authenticated interaction context for a single     user, tracked by an opaque server-side token.
          </definition>
          <disambiguation>
            Not an HTTP session in the cookie sense; these     sessions are first-class entities with their own lifecycle.
          </disambiguation>
        </vocab-entry>
      </term>
    </vocabulary>

# Vocabulary rules

* ``<vocabulary>`` is optional. If you include it, it comes after ``<features>`` in the output, as a sibling block, and must contain at least one ``<term>`` entry.
* Each ``<term>`` has a ``name`` attribute (the term being defined) and a ``scope`` attribute that is exactly ``"project"`` or ``"feature"``.
  * ``scope="project"`` means the term is relevant project-wide     and should be in every regen prompt context at every tier.
  * ``scope="feature"`` means the term is specific to one     feature's subtree. It also requires a ``feature-name``     attribute whose value matches an exact feature name in the     same ``<features>`` block.
* Each ``<term>`` contains exactly one ``<vocab-entry>`` child. The ``<vocab-entry>`` has three possible children in fixed order:
  * ``<definition>`` — **required**, non-empty prose describing     the term. Plain text or fenced code blocks; no nested XML     tags.
  * ``<disambiguation>`` — **optional** but strongly encouraged     for any term whose project-specific meaning diverges from a     common meaning. A "not to be confused with" note that     directly counteracts the default generic meaning the LLM     would otherwise assume. Plain text, no nested XML.
  * ``<see-also>`` — **optional**. A list of ``<ref name="..."/>``     elements cross-referencing other terms defined in the same     ``<vocabulary>`` block. Do not reference terms that don't     exist yet — this is the cold-start pass, so all references     use the name form (``name=``) not the id form.
* Term names must be unique within a scope. Two project-level terms cannot share a name. Two feature-local terms within the same feature cannot share a name. A project-level term and a feature-local term *can* share a name — scope disambiguates them.
* Scan the input doc for terms the user uses in a project-specific sense — "boulder," "tranche," "widget," or any phrase that seems loaded with meaning particular to the project — and extract them as vocabulary entries. Guideline: *if a generic LLM reading the term in isolation would get it subtly wrong, define it in vocabulary*.
* Vocabulary entries are not features. Don't confuse the two: features describe *what the project does*; vocabulary describes *what words the project uses*.
