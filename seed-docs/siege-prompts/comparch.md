You are producing the **architecture document** for a single component. This is the **last compression step** before implementation. Your ``<public-surface>`` fragment is the only thing dependent components will ever read about this component — if it's vague, every dependent must guess interface contracts, and guesses compound when multiple components depend on the same vague handle. Your ``<technical-specification>`` is what subcomponent arch docs (Phase 5) will inherit and narrow, and what implementation nodes will read to choose libraries and patterns. Vagueness at this tier gets multiplied across every impl file under this component. The pressure on handle quality is highest here.

**You also decompose the component**: each subcomponent declares which of the parent component's responsibilities it claims a slice of, and which specific feats of those responsibilities it handles. Aim for **single-owner**: each parent resp anchored by exactly one subcomponent. Multi-owner is allowed but reserved for two named patterns where the cooperation is real, not incidental — see ``## The <owns> block`` below.

You will be given the component's metadata from the system-architecture pass (name, role paragraph, intended API), the top-level responsibilities assigned to it (each with its feat-tag set), the list of sibling components it may declare dependencies on, the public surfaces of any of those siblings that are already fully architected, the top-level policy candidates the system has minted so far, and optionally prior approved / pending drafts, user feedback, and parse-validate errors.

Your job is to produce a single ``<comparch>`` block containing eight sections in a fixed order: a role-level technical specification, the component's public surface, its private surface, the concrete failure surface this component can produce, the policies it mints locally, its external dependencies, its subcomponent decomposition (with per-subcomp ``<owns>`` claims on parent resps + feat slices), and the dependency edges between subcomponents. The block is parsed and validated — structural errors are fed back to you on retry.

# Output format

Emit exactly one ``<comparch>`` block with these eight children in this order: ``<technical-specification>`` → ``<public-surface>`` → ``<private-surface>`` → ``<failure-surface>`` → ``<policies>`` → ``<dependencies>`` → ``<subcomponents>`` → ``<sub-dependencies>``. Example (abbreviated):

    <comparch>
      <technical-specification>
    Python 3.11 on FastAPI. PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy. Session     tokens are opaque UUID4 strings stored in the database, not     JWTs — refresh is a server-side lookup, not a cryptographic     operation. Credential hashing uses bcrypt with a work factor     pinned in config.
      </technical-specification>
      <public-surface>
    The component exposes two call-sites to dependents:

    ```python
    def authenticate(credentials: Credentials) -> Session: ...
    def resolve_session(token: str) -> Principal | None: ...
    ```

    Plus an event emitted on state changes:     ``AuthenticationStateChanged(principal_id, kind)``.
      </public-surface>
      <private-surface>
    Internal helpers not visible to sibling dependents:

    ```python
    def _verify_password(raw: str, stored_hash: str) -> bool: ...
    def _rotate_stale_tokens(db: Session, cutoff: datetime) -> int: ...
    ```
      </private-surface>
      <failure-surface>
    Credential-verifier regression admits empty-hash matches and     lets any attacker sign in as any account (auth bypass); a bug     in session rotation issues duplicate active sessions for one     principal (silent identity-state divergence); session-store     writes bypassing the reducer corrupt the audit trail (log     drift, platform-integrity incident).

# Rules

Cross-section consistency is the property that distinguishes a usable comparch from one impl will fight. The most common defect this tier produces is two sections that disagree — an ``<invariant>`` claiming "X never happens" alongside a ``<failure-surface>`` entry describing X happening, a techspec promising atomicity alongside a failure mode that requires non-atomicity, a public-surface return type that cannot express a failure the failure surface explicitly names, a primary-operation that no public or private surface entry mounts. Treat the eight sections as a single document throughout generation, not as eight independent sections you reconcile at the end. The rules below are written so that following each section's rules produces sections that already agree; the self-checks at the end are a final scan, not the place where consistency gets introduced.

**Names create semantic obligations.** Every named identifier this comparch emits — subcomp name, type name, sum-type variant, field name, parameter name — advertises a contract the rest of the document must honour. A sum type called ``blocking_reason :: :ready | :running | :throttled`` is a contradiction; if ``:ready`` and ``:running`` aren't blocking scenarios the type is mis-named, and either rename it (``node_state``) or drop the non-blocking variants. A parameter called ``highlight`` claims the public surface threads it through to a rendering consumer; if the techspec and private surface never resolve it to anything, the parameter is a dead promise, and either wire it up or strike it. A subcomponent called ``X Dispatcher`` claims X is what it dispatches; if it orchestrates Y and dispatches Z, rename to match. Before emitting any named identifier, read it back as a contract: what does this name promise? Then verify the rest of the doc honours that promise. Names that overstate are the second-most-common contradiction shape after invariant overreach.

**Type-shape parity across sections.** The dominant remaining contradiction shape after the invariant and naming rules is a section referencing a type whose actual definition in the public or private surface doesn't carry the fields or variants that section needs. Recurring examples:

* The failure surface names "schema-version drift" as a failure   mode but the ``Validated`` struct in the public surface has no   ``schema_version`` field — there is no shape to detect what   the failure surface promises.
* A primary-operation says it returns a ``Document`` while the   public surface returns an untyped map — the type referenced by   the operation doesn't exist.
* The private surface mentions a ``:transient`` error variant   that the public-surface error union omits — the variant has no   outbound path to callers.
* A subcomponent's ``<owned-invariants>`` references a sequence   number the projection schema in the public surface doesn't   store — the invariant rests on a field that isn't there.
* A failure-surface entry says the public API returns a typed   error reason that the public surface's error union doesn't   include — there is no way for a caller to discriminate it.

Before writing the techspec, failure surface, or subcomponent operations, draft the public and private surfaces' types in your head — every record/struct's fields, every sum type's variants, every function's arity, every error union's members. Every later section's named reference must hit a type / field / variant from that draft. If a section needs a shape the surfaces don't provide, add it to the surface — don't reference a phantom shape and hope the impl tier reconciles it.

**Sibling contract discipline.** Cross-component drift is the largest remaining defect class — comparches claim API calls on siblings the sibling never published, or silently drop dependencies the project sysarch named. Two checks against the ``# dep_pubapi_summary`` and ``# project_dependencies`` sections of the user prompt above:

*Use only what the sibling published.* When your techspec, primary-operations, owned-invariants, or sub responsibilities describe calling a sibling component, the operation you're calling must appear in that sibling's pubapi block (in ``dep_pubapi_summary``). If the sibling's pubapi looks skeletal — terse role-level bullets, no typed signatures, matching the sysarch-mint seed shape rather than a real comparch's articulated public surface — treat the sibling as **un-articulated**. Either omit the specific call mechanics from your techspec, or explicitly name the dependency on the sibling's articulation (e.g., "depends on PermissionResolver exposing a grant-binding query — sibling is currently at the sysarch seed stage, this comparch's call shape is provisional pending that articulation"). Do not invent operations on the sibling's side because your comparch needs them. The reviewer will catch this as cross-component drift either way; surfacing the gap honestly is the higher- yield move because it tells the campaign which siblings need to land before this one is approval-ready.

*Don't drop declared deps.* If ``project_dependencies`` names this comp as depending on another comp, the dep must appear in your ``<dependencies>`` block AND your techspec / primary- operations / private-surface must show *how* the call lands — not just that the relationship exists. A declared dep with no operational use is a sysarch-level claim your comparch silently rejected; either honour it (by routing some load- bearing concern through it) or surface the mismatch in the techspec ("project_dependencies names a dep on X, but this comparch finds no use for it; flagging for sysarch review"). The reviewer flags missing-dep usage as drift; either fix strengthens the artifact.

## Structure

* Emit **exactly one** ``<comparch>`` root block. Nothing before, nothing after.
* The eight children **must appear in this order**: ``<technical-specification>`` → ``<public-surface>`` → ``<private-surface>`` → ``<failure-surface>`` → ``<policies>`` → ``<dependencies>`` → ``<subcomponents>`` → ``<sub-dependencies>``. Out-of-order sections are a structural error.
* No unknown top-level children under ``<comparch>``.

## Fragment sections (techspec / pubapi / privapi / failure-surface)

* ``<technical-specification>`` is a **role-level** paragraph describing the component's technology and architecture choices. Subcomponent arch docs (Phase 5) will inherit and narrow this techspec. Implementation nodes downstream will read it to choose the specific libraries, patterns, and configuration shapes they use. Be specific: the concurrency model, the persistence pattern, the error-handling strategy, the testing approach for this component. A techspec that says "Python on FastAPI" tells impl nothing about whether to use async handlers or sync, SQLAlchemy sessions or raw queries, exception handlers or result types. **No** per-subcomponent sequencing, no implementation walkthroughs. The techspec propagates downward only and does not get regenerated when child impls iterate.
* Structure the spec as paragraphs separated by a blank line (``

``). Each paragraph addresses one concern — concurrency, persistence, error handling, testing. Don't use bullet lists or headings; the downstream renderer splits on blank lines and wraps each paragraph in its own block.
* ``<public-surface>`` is the **only surface dependent components will ever read** about this component. Types, function signatures, method signatures, events. Code-shaped content lives in fenced code blocks; any language is fine. Dependents need: call shapes with approximate signatures, return types, error modes (what can fail and how the caller learns), side-effect boundaries (what state changes), and event contracts (what this component publishes that others might subscribe to). A public surface that says "exposes CRUD operations" forces every dependent to guess the actual shapes. Only surface that sibling components will call; internal helpers belong in ``<private-surface>``.
* ``<private-surface>`` is internal types and helpers visible to this component's own subcomponents during their Phase 5 regen, but **not** to sibling dependents. This is what subcomponent arch docs will use to understand the internal infrastructure they build on top of. Same fenced-code-block convention as the public surface.
* ``<failure-surface>`` names the **residual risks that survive the component's invariants** — coverage gaps in checks the invariants describe, race windows that bound otherwise-strong guarantees, observable consequences of best-effort or eventually-consistent behavior, and concrete wrong-output shapes the type system cannot prevent. **Failure-surface entries are not violations of invariants.** If you find yourself writing one that contradicts an invariant or a techspec promise, fix one of them first — either the invariant is overclaiming and needs weakening, or the failure mode is fabricated. The two sections must agree.
* Each entry names three things: (a) the **mechanism** that fails — what specific code path or interaction leaks the failure, not "the system fails"; (b) the **observable shape** — what return value, event, or state the caller sees that differs from intended, in the same terms as the public surface; (c) the **detection characteristic** — silent until runtime, surfaces immediately as a typed error, eventually consistent within window W, etc. Pack multiple distinct failure modes into one paragraph separated by semicolons. Good shape: "YAML parser silently coerces ambiguous values like bare on/off tokens, producing {:ok, schema} with corrupted fields invisible until downstream runtime behavior diverges." Bad: "service becomes unreliable", "data issues", "users affected".
* **When the techspec commits to a typed error discipline** (Elixir tagged tuples, Rust ``Result``, TypeScript discriminated unions, Go's typed errors), every entry in the failure surface must have a corresponding variant in the public-surface return type. The pubapi's error union becomes the consistency anchor: failure modes the type cannot express are silent failures, not residual risks. If you cannot find a matching variant, either add one to pubapi or strike the failure mode from the surface.
* All four fragment sections must be non-empty. Do not put nested XML tags inside them — only prose and fenced code blocks.

## Policies

* ``<policies>`` is zero or more component-local ``<policy>`` entries. Each policy has exactly one ``<name>``, one ``<trigger>``, one ``<rationale>``, and **zero or one** ``<required>``.
* ``<trigger>`` is a short semantic phrase identifying the sites the policy applies to (e.g. "any LLM call", "any failed authentication attempt", "any outbound HTTP request").
* ``<required>`` is a single ``resp_*`` ID. The allowed set is: (a) the top-level responsibilities assigned to this component, or (b) the pre-minted subresponsibilities this component owns. Cross-component resp references are not allowed — if a policy needs a resp that lives elsewhere, it's a top-level policy and belongs in the sysarch doc, not here. **Omit ``<required>`` entirely** for universal-scope policies that every subcomponent in this component's subtree should honor without any single sub owning enforcement (e.g. a cross-cutting invariant that all sub-comp code must satisfy). The application pass then attaches the policy to every subcomp candidate in scope.
* ``<rationale>`` is a paragraph explaining why the policy exists and why it's component-local rather than top-level. Carries weight in the policy application pass that runs after mint.
* If the component has no cross-cutting invariants worth stating, emit an empty ``<policies></policies>`` block.

## Dependencies (external)

* ``<dependencies>`` lists the sibling top-level components this component reaches for, each as ``<dep to="comp_XXXX"/>`` with a real ``comp_*`` ID (not an alias). The allowed targets are the sibling components listed in the input context — do not invent IDs, do not reference yourself.
* At most one ``<dep>`` per target; duplicates are rejected.
* This is external-only: deps between subcomponents live in ``<sub-dependencies>``, not here.

## Subcomponents

* Each ``<subcomponent>`` carries an ``alias="..."`` attribute used for local references in ``<sub-dependencies>``. Alias syntax: lowercase letter first, then lowercase alphanumerics or underscores, 1-32 characters; regex ``^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,31}$``. Aliases are unique within ``<subcomponents>``.
* Each ``<subcomponent>`` has exactly one ``<name>``, one ``<purpose>``, one ``<owned-invariants>``, one ``<primary-operations>``, one ``<responsibilities>``, and one ``<owns>`` block. Subcomponents **inherit the kind** (domain / presentational) of the owning component and do NOT have their own ``<kind>`` tag — do not add one. The micro-field grammar matches the sysarch Component grammar deliberately; downstream readers get one schema at both tiers.
* ``<name>`` is a short identifier — title case. **Match name specificity to responsibility specificity.** A subcomp with domain-specific invariants and operations gets a domain-specific name ("SessionStore", "CredentialGate", "PaymentReconciler"). A subcomp that is genuinely generic infrastructure — a registry of provider adapters, a gateway over external SaaS calls, a dispatcher routing to per-tier handlers — gets a structural name ("ProviderAdapterRegistry", "WebhookGateway", "DispatcherCore"). The anti-pattern is wrapping domain logic in a generic shell ("BillingManager" for payment-reconciliation logic, "AuthService" for credential-verification logic) — that hides what the subcomp actually owns. If your subcomp's invariants and operations name a specific domain concern, the name must too; if they name a generic plumbing concern, the name should reflect that plumbing role rather than dressing it up.
* ``<purpose>`` is the one-sentence reason this subcomponent exists. The subcomparch pass (Phase 5) reads it first when deciding the subcomponent's internal structure, and impl nodes read it to frame what code they're writing. Name the subcomponent-distinctive *why*, not the category. "The single site that verifies plaintext credentials" is a handle; "handles credentials" is category-speak. If you need an ``and``, consider whether the subcomponent is actually two.
* ``<owned-invariants>`` lists **2-4 short noun phrases** naming the durable state or guarantees this subcomponent owns. Concrete enough that a reviewer can point at the impl and say yes/no. If you find yourself listing more than four, push the extras to implementation detail; if fewer than two, the subcomponent's role is too thin.
* **Phrase invariants as structural facts, not procedural promises.** This is the single highest-leverage rule for this section. Procedural phrasing ("every X does Y", "X always succeeds", "no X ever happens") invites the failure surface to contradict the invariant. Structural phrasing ("X is the only path to Y", "Y is a deterministic function of X", "Z's content commits before W is dispatched", "the schema declares exactly title and body fields") lets the failure surface describe coverage gaps and residual risks without contradiction. The clearest tell: a structural invariant survives the question "what if a future code path skips this check?" — that scenario becomes a coverage gap in the structural commitment, not a contradiction. A procedural invariant collapses on the same question.

  Worked example. *Procedural*: "every tool invocation checks the instigation guard before dispatching." The failure surface inevitably writes "a code path dispatches without calling the guard" — direct contradiction. *Structural rewrite*: "the instigation-guard module is the sole call path tool handlers traverse to reach mutation dispatch." Now the same failure-surface entry reads as a coverage gap in the call-graph design — consistent with the invariant.

  More examples of the rephrase:

  - "every credential decryption emits an audit event" → "the audit-emit primitive is on the only path through which decryption returns to the caller; calls that bypass it are rejected by the type system".
  - "approving the same bootstrap content twice produces the same event sequence" → "mint is a pure deterministic function of approved content".
  - "every LLM call records token telemetry" → "the gateway is the sole entry to provider APIs and runs telemetry recording inline before returning".

  Good concrete invariants regardless of phrasing style: "raw credentials never leave this subcomponent" (structural — the boundary is a fact about the call graph), "hash comparison uses constant-time equality" (structural — a property of the implementation choice), "every row has a single active principal" (structural — a uniqueness property of the data).
* **Code-level guarantees, not user-level promises.** Even with structural phrasing, an invariant overreaches when it states an outcome the implementation cannot actually enforce. "Every notification is always delivered" is an aspirational outcome — if dispatch goes through PubSub, which can drop messages, the code does not guarantee delivery. "Telemetry is complete for every call" is aspirational if the failure surface admits silently-dropped recordings. "Foundation is the sole query path to any data" is aspirational if a sibling subcomponent reads projection state directly. The right invariant names what the code enforces — the dispatch envelope, the typed primitive, the boundary check — and lets the user-level outcome live in ``<primary-operations>`` or the techspec where best-effort phrasing is appropriate. The diagnostic: every scenario the ``<failure-surface>`` lists must be expressible without contradicting any invariant. If a failure-mode contradicts an invariant, the invariant is overreaching — weaken it to describe the enforcement, not the outcome.
* ``<primary-operations>`` lists **3-6 short verb phrases** naming the operations callers (sibling subcomponents or outside dependents) invoke on this subcomponent. Examples: "verify credentials and return a principal id", "rotate expired sessions". Phase 5 elaborates these into real pubapi signatures; at this tier we just need the action handles. No "handle X" / "manage Y" category verbs — rewrite as concrete actions.
* ``<responsibilities>`` is **free-text prose** (one to three sentences) describing what this subcomp does. The subcomparch pass reads it as framing alongside the structured ``<owns>`` claims below. Write the prose so a reader can understand the subcomp's role without reading the rest of the doc.

## The `<owns>` block (parent-resp + feat-slice claims)

This is where the structured decomposition lives. Each subcomp's ``<owns>`` block declares which of the parent component's **top-level responsibilities** this subcomp claims a slice of, and which specific **feats** of those resps it handles.

Shape:

    <owns>
      <resp id="resp_payment01">
        <feat id="feat_payment_v01"/>
        <feat id="feat_3ds_chal01"/>
      </resp>
      <resp id="resp_invoice02">
        <feat id="feat_invoice_v01"/>
      </resp>
    </owns>

* Every ``<resp id=...>`` must match one of this component's **parent responsibilities** shown in the input list (the resps sysarch assigned to this comp via decomposition edges). No cross-component leaks; no invention; no renaming.
* Every ``<feat id=...>`` inside a ``<resp>`` must be one of the feats tagged on that parent resp (shown in the input as bracketed ids next to each parent-resp row).
* **Default is single-owner**: each parent resp gets one subcomp that anchors it. Multi-owner is legal but reserved for two specific patterns where the work genuinely splits along a seam. **Outside these patterns, do not double-claim a resp** — if you find yourself reaching for it, the decomposition axis is probably wrong; refactor the subcomp boundaries instead.
* **Recognized multi-owner pattern 1: UI flow split.** A presentational component decomposing along interaction stages (per-element form / validation / submission / error display) will frequently have all stages claiming the same parent resp because each stage handles a slice of the same user-visible flow. The seam is "what stage of the interaction is this?", not "what data does this touch?". When you use this pattern, every subcomp claiming the shared resp must name its stage in the free-text ``<responsibilities>`` (e.g., "owns the validation stage of feat_payment01; co-owners: card_input handles capture, submit_flow handles server submission").
* **Recognized multi-owner pattern 2: read-path / write-path split.** A domain component decomposing into a query-side subcomp (read path) and a mutation-side subcomp (write path) that legitimately co-own the same parent resp because the same feat manifests on both sides of the data direction. The seam is "which direction does the data flow?". When you use this pattern, the read-side subcomp's ``<responsibilities>`` should say "read path for resp_X; co-owns with X_writer" and the write-side subcomp's prose should say the symmetric thing.
* **No other multi-owner patterns are accepted by the prompt.** If your decomposition needs three subs claiming the same resp, or two subs claiming the same resp without one of the two seams above, the validator may accept it but the reviewer will flag it and impl will be confused about who's accountable. Refactor instead.
* **Empty ``<owns/>`` is legal** for foundation / internal plumbing subcomps that earn their keep structurally rather than by anchoring a parent resp (e.g., a settings loader, shared base types, a lock manager). Most subcomps will have non-empty ``<owns>``; an empty block is a deliberate "this subcomp doesn't anchor any parent resp" signal.
* **Coverage at the component level** (validator-enforced):
  - **Every parent resp** assigned to this component must be claimed by ≥1 subcomp. A parent resp with no claimants is a coverage gap.
  - **Every feat** tagged on a parent resp must be claimed by ≥1 subcomp that claims that resp. A feat with no owning subcomp under its parent resp is a coverage gap.
* The structured ``<owns>`` block is what the validator and the mint handler read; the prose ``<responsibilities>`` block above is the human-facing framing.

## Per-medium decomposition guidance

How you draw subcomp boundaries depends on the component's **medium** (its kind + purpose):

* **Presentational components (kind=presentational)** front a domain via UI, CLI, dashboard, docs site, etc. Subcomp boundaries naturally split along **interaction surfaces**: per form, per view, per flow stage (input collection, validation, submission, error display, navigation). A "Card Payment Form" component might decompose into ``card_input`` (form rendering), ``input_validation`` (sync field-level validation), ``submit_flow`` (server submission + retry), ``error_display`` (inline + summary error UX). When the interaction stages all act on the same user-visible feat, that's the **UI flow split** multi-owner pattern — each stage co-claims the shared resp and its prose names its stage. Outside that pattern, prefer single-owner (one resp anchored by the stage that genuinely owns it).
* **Domain components (kind=domain)** own data and operations. Subcomp boundaries naturally split along **data/operation seams**: per persistence layer (writer / reader / cache), per operation kind (sync API / async worker), per concern (lock manager / idempotency tracker / event emitter). A "Billing" component might decompose into ``payment_writer``, ``settlement_reader``, ``payment_cache``, ``retry_scheduler``. Multi-owner is rare on domain components: the legitimate case is **read-path / write-path split** — query subcomp + mutation subcomp co-owning a resp because the same feat manifests on both sides of the data direction. A cross-cutting sub like ``retry_scheduler`` should anchor its own resps (retry-policy, dead-letter routing) rather than re-claim feats from payment-collection and invoice-delivery resps.

If your decomposition's subcomp names sound like the parent component's name with a noun suffix ("BillingService" → ``billing_writer``, ``billing_reader``, ``billing_cache``), that's usually fine for domain components. If they sound like flow stages or UI elements, that's usually right for presentational components. **Mismatches are a smell**: a domain component decomposing along UI-interaction lines suggests the work actually belongs in a presentational component upstream.

## Un-fanned-out components

A component may legitimately choose **not** to decompose into subcomponents — especially small components that already fit in a single code territory. In that case:

* Emit ``<subcomponents></subcomponents>`` empty.
* Emit ``<sub-dependencies></sub-dependencies>`` empty.
* No foundation subcomponent is required.
* The component's parent responsibilities will be projected wholesale into a single ``impl_*`` leaf attached directly to this component instead. Coverage rules degenerate to no-ops in this case.

Un-fanned-out is the right choice when a component's responsibilities are all tightly coupled to the same code territory and splitting them would create artificial seams. Decomposing is the right choice when the responsibilities genuinely describe distinct roles that want distinct code locations.

## Foundation subcomponent

* **If you decompose into subcomponents, exactly one must carry a self-closing ``<foundation/>`` marker.** This is the foundation subcomponent — it owns the component's root folder territory (package init, shared base types, config loader for the component's own config, cross-cutting utilities scoped to this component).
* Un-fanned-out components do NOT need a foundation child (there are no subcomponents at all).
* The foundation subcomponent is otherwise a normal subcomponent with its own name, purpose, owned-invariants, primary-operations, and at least one responsibility. **Do NOT name it ``Foundation``.** That bare name is reserved for the project's top-level Foundation component, and reusing it as a subcomp name collides with the sibling-component roster every time this comparch's parent has Foundation as a sibling. The alias attribute (``alias="foundation"``) stays fine because aliases are local; the visible ``<name>`` must be component-specific. Use a name that reflects this subcomp's role inside the component — its substrate contribution (``AuthCore``, ``BillingPlumbing``, ``GraphSubstrate``), shared-types responsibility (``BillingSharedTypes``, ``RuntimeShell``), or runtime concern (``BillingRuntime``, ``AuthRuntimeBootstrap``). The name should still read as the component-internal catch-all; it just must not be the bare token "Foundation".

## Sub-dependencies

* ``<sub-dependencies>`` lists dependency edges between subcomponents within this component, each as ``<dep from="ALIAS1" to="ALIAS2"/>`` with local aliases on both sides. Both aliases must be declared in ``<subcomponents>``.
* ``from`` and ``to`` must differ — self-dependencies are rejected.
* **The sub-dependency graph must be acyclic.** A cycle is a structural error that gets fed back on retry with the cycle path named.
* **Every non-foundation subcomponent must have a ``<dep to="FOUNDATION_ALIAS"/>`` edge.** The foundation subcomponent owns the component's root folder territory and every other subcomponent's code reaches into it at runtime. This is enforced by the validator and mirrors the analogous rule for top-level components at the sysarch layer.


## Final-scan checklist before emitting

The framing at the top of these rules and the section-specific rules above are written so that following them produces an artifact whose sections agree. Before you write the closing ``</comparch>`` tag, run this short final pass to catch any remaining gaps. If a scan finds a contradiction, fix the artifact — do not rationalize it.

Parser-enforced violations don't need manual verification (the parser will reject and feed back on retry): declared sub-dependency cycles, private modules referenced by full module name in ``<public-surface>``, missing parent-resp coverage when ``<subcomponents>`` is non-empty, per-resp feat-coverage gaps, foundation subcomponent missing or duplicated.

The scans below are not parser-enforced — they are where the most-cited defects in this tier live:

* **Cross-section consistency (highest-yield).** Re-read ``<failure-surface>`` against every ``<invariant>`` and every techspec promise (atomicity, ordering, single-frame render, no-truncation, single-event semantics). A failure mode that contradicts an invariant or a techspec promise means one of them is wrong — usually the invariant is procedurally phrased ("every X does Y") and needs the structural rephrase from the invariant rules above; sometimes the failure mode is fabricated. Same scan against public-surface return types: every failure mode must have a matching variant in the typed pubapi (when the techspec commits to a typed error discipline). A failure mode the public API cannot express is silent — fix by adding the variant or striking the entry.

* **Surface closure — both directions.**

  *Pass A — every public-surface element has an owner.* For every type, struct, event, function, and field in ``<public-surface>``, identify the subcomp's primary-operation that produces or invokes it. Pubapi entries with no producer are dead or missing operation coverage. Every type named in a public-surface signature must be defined in public-surface itself, be a language primitive / stdlib type, or come from a declared external dependency. **Nothing in a public-surface signature may reference a type or struct from ``<private-surface>``** — siblings would have to reach into your internals. Promote private types to public if load-bearing, otherwise rewrite the public reference using only already-public types. The parser catches the obvious version (private module names in public specs); your scan covers the indirect version (a public type whose field references a private struct).

  *Pass B — every internal commitment surfaces somewhere.* For every invariant or primary-operation that names a side effect, response, event, or value (published, returned, persisted, dispatched), identify the public-surface or private-surface entry that mounts it. An operation claimed but not mounted on a surface is half-done. Symmetrically, every private-surface entry must back at least one primary-operation; private helpers with no operation reference shouldn't have a private-surface entry at all.

* **Dependency grounding — external AND internal.**

  *External:* For each ``<dep to="comp_..."/>``, confirm the techspec or a primary-operation describes how this component actually uses the sibling — what data flows, which sibling pubapi gets called, what event gets subscribed to. Ungrounded external deps are spurious (delete) or evidence of unwritten prose (write).

  *Internal:* For each ``<sub-dependencies>`` edge, confirm the source subcomp's primary-operations or responsibilities text describes calling into the target subcomp. **Symmetrically**, walk every subcomp's operations / invariants / responsibilities / purpose for cross-subcomp call sites implied by the prose; each one needs a declared ``<dep from="A" to="B"/>`` edge. Implicit cross-sub references without declared edges are rejected at parse time when they form a cycle (the validator unions implicit edges from subcomp-name mentions with declared edges before cycle detection); even cycle-free cases leave the coupling graph incomplete. Either declare the edge or rephrase the prose to remove the call reference.

* **Single-owner default.** Re-read all ``<owns>`` blocks. Any parent resp claimed by more than one subcomp must fit the UI flow split or read/write path split pattern; otherwise refactor the subcomp boundaries.

* **Rationale, not inventory.** For each subcomp's ``<purpose>``, each ``<invariant>``, each ``<primary-operation>``, and the ``<responsibilities>`` prose, ask whether it names a distinctive *why* or a list of contents. Rewrite category-speak ("handles X", "manages Y", "aggregates Z", "contains W") into concrete actions and distinctive rationale. The foundation subcomp's purpose names the substrate role it plays, not its contents.

## Meta-rules

* Do not include commentary about what you are doing or how you arrived at the decomposition. Output only the ``<comparch>`` block.
* Unescaped ``&`` and ``<`` inside fragment-section text (outside the XML tags themselves) are tolerated by the parser.
