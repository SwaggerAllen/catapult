# substrate

The elixir-target platform substrate: everything a Catapult-built app
(and Catapult itself) adopts to honor the convention corpus. Shipped
as a hex package via the registry; Catapult consumes it as a path dep
— the plane is its first consumer.

## Owns

The component behaviour (`use Catapult.Component`) and its registry
callbacks (config/Vapor with secret flags, pubsub topics, Oban
queues with cron annotations, telemetry events, `events/0`,
`processes/0`, seeds, `errors/0` — boundary failure vocabulary with
remedies, `externals/0` — wrapped third-party services; v5 §2.2);
the compile-time root composer with collision checks; the boundary-export macro (telemetry
spans now, `@requires_permission` enforcement when identity lands);
`mix catapult.audit` and its check registry; the health-endpoint
plug (SHA + per-component readiness); the injected clock behaviour;
the seeds release task.

## Standing decisions

- **One macro layer, two concerns.** Telemetry instrumentation and
  permission enforcement ride the same boundary-export macro —
  built once, because both need the same interception point and two
  macro layers on one function is a composition bug farm.
- **The audit is a check registry, not a monolith.** Platform
  extensions (v5 §9) register checks; the ES family registers the
  purity floor, delivery registers file-map checks. Rationale: the
  audit grows for the life of the platform; a registry grows by
  entries, a monolith by merge conflicts.
- **Registries fail the build on collision, never warn.** A warning
  about a name collision is a collision that ships.
- **The supply gate is Hex-sourced; `mix_audit` is a second opinion,
  not the signal.** `mix deps.audit` reads a third-party git mirror
  (`mirego/elixir-security-advisories`) cloned at run time and
  matched by package name and version range, and it disagrees with
  Hex on the tree we actually ship — verified against cowlib 2.19.0,
  three independent ways. The mirror's range for GHSA-g2wm-735q-3f56
  stops at `<= 2.16.1` where the advisory itself says "affects from
  2.9.0" with no patched release; GHSA-w4f7-4cxr-rv3c is filed there
  under `gun`, so a cowlib dependency never matches it; and when the
  clone fails, `MixAudit.Repo.synchronize/0` discards the `git` exit
  status, globs an empty directory, prints "No vulnerabilities
  found." and exits 0. That last one is the reason for this decision:
  a gate whose failure mode is a clean report is worse than no gate.
  `mix hex.audit` is a built-in Hex task — no dependency to add — it
  exits 1 on findings, and its data rides the registry fetch that
  `deps.get --check-locked` already requires, so a fetch it could not
  perform fails the build earlier instead of passing here. Both run;
  only the Hex one is load-bearing. **Retirement is Hex's alone** —
  `mix_audit` has no retirement check at any version, so the gate set
  did not cover retired packages until `hex.audit` joined it.
  Accepted residue, named so it is not rediscovered: an advisory that
  reaches the GitHub database and not Hex's feed, on a run where the
  mirror clone also failed, still reports clean.
- **An advisory we cannot act on is acknowledged in `mix.exs`, never
  absorbed by a blind gate.** Arming a Hex-sourced gate against a
  tree with two unpatched cowlib advisories fails every build until
  upstream ships a release we do not control, so the gate needs a way
  to say "seen, and nothing to do yet": Hex's
  `hex: [ignore_advisories: [...]]`, listing advisory IDs, which
  prints them under *Ignored advisories* and exits 0. The exit code
  matches today's; the epistemic status does not, and that is the
  entire change — "No vulnerabilities found." becomes a named list
  with an author behind it. It stays honest in both directions: an
  advisory that is not on the list still fails the build, and an
  entry matching nothing in the lockfile warns that it can be
  removed, so the acknowledgement expires by itself the day the
  dependency is bumped. Acknowledgements are per-ID and never
  per-package — ignoring `cowlib` wholesale would re-blind the gate
  to the next advisory against it, which is the failure this
  decision exists to prevent.
- **Substrate carries its own supply gate and never takes an audit
  dependency to get one.** It resolves its own lockfile, so the
  root's audit does not cover it — the versions coincide today, which
  is luck rather than a property, and nothing would report the day
  they diverge. It is Apache-2.0 and ships into generated projects
  (`LICENSING.md`), so a dependency added here lands in every tree
  built from it; `hex.audit` needing nothing in `deps` is precisely
  what makes the gate affordable at this end.

## Initial vs target

Initial (Phase 1): behaviour + registries, export macro
(telemetry-only), audit v0, health, clock, seeds. Target: permission
enforcement wired to identity's principal behaviour; the full check
registry; published on the release train.

## Depends on

Nothing in this repo (it is the bottom). Vapor, Boundary, PromEx as
library deps.
